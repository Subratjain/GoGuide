            <h3>When people hear the phrase “competitive programming”, some of them conjure up images of hackers pulling
                all-nighters trying to build the best app or website over a weekend.
                <br><br>But it's not like that Competitive programming is an intellectual sport where coders race each
                other to solve the most algorithmic problems within a limited amount of time.
                What is wrong is we start late many a times which becomes major problem.

                    <p>The first step to getting started with competitive programming is to learn a programming
                        language. If you already have a preference, any language would do.
                        If you have just started learning a new language, C, C++, or Java are the most recommended
                        languages as most problems are set, keeping in mind these languages. The reason is that time of
                        execution is a critical factor in Competitive Programming. Choosing a language whose time of
                        execution is fast is sure to give you an advantage</p>

                    <p>You do not need to know advanced concepts, like classes or generics/templates. You should know
                        if/else, loops, arrays, functions and have some familiarity with the standard library, like math
                        functions, string/array operations, and input/output.</p>

                There are lots of great platforms that you can choose from to get started with. We would recommend
                starting with HackerRank and Atcoder (Beginner).It has the most beginner-friendly interface, IDE, and
                suitable problems to learn and develop fundamental problem-solving skills and master the languages.

    <div class="Note">
        <p class="Note1">Note: Start your quest by solving simple problems such as finding a prime number, the number of
            factors of a number, the number of digits in a given number, searching a number in an array, basic problems
            using loops, functions, and string, etc. These types of problems can be found in HackerRank as recommended.

            These problems might seem simple, but constantly practicing these problems at the beginning of your journey
            will improve your speed, thinking, and develop an essential skill of writing error-free code.</p>

                    Structures and Algorithms will be your long-term partner who will help you solve problems with
                    low time and space complexities.
                    The time complexity of an algorithm is the algorithm's amount of time to complete its process as
                    a function of its input length, n. The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed
                    using asymptotic notations:</p>

        <p> In Competitive Programming, it is crucial to be consistent and constantly keep solving problems daily.

            When practicing, sometimes, you will not be able to solve problems. In these situations, Do not give
            yourself up quickly! Continue to try! However, sometimes, we are not able to solve it even after struggling
            for hours.
            It is advisable to look at the editorials in those situations. Step-by-step editorials clarify how to solve
            a problem. You will also learn new and creative ways to solve problems by reading them. So often, even
            though you have been
            able to solve a problem, you should read editorials. Also, sometimes you should look at other codes. It also
            helps you find new ways to solve problems.

            Competitive Programming is much fun when you involve your friends. Continually participating in contests
            with your friends and discussing different approaches will keep you motivated and pumped up always.Once you
            understand the techniques of solving the problem and become quite familiar with the language and problem
            solving, it is highly recommended to start participating in contests on platforms such as Codeforces,
            CodeChef, or LeetCode.
